# WhatsApp Extended Emoticon Shortcuts
Simple Chrome extension that adds support for popular shortcuts for certain emoticons. You can type:

    :smiling:

And the extension will replace that on the fly with the actual smiley. Particulary useful if you don't want to use the mouse to open the emoticons menu.

## Adding support for more smileys
Open up `code.js`. At the top there's a dictionary where you can add support for more.
